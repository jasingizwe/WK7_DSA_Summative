CONTROL FLOW ANALYSIS:

ðŸ”¸ Instruction:
asm
Copy
Edit
jne 0x40114e
ðŸ”¸ Meaning:
jne stands for Jump if Not Equal. It checks the Zero Flag (ZF) after a comparison:

If ZF = 0 (i.e., values are not equal), the program jumps to address 0x40114e.

If ZF = 1 (values are equal), it continues to the next instruction.

ðŸ”¸ Effect on Control Flow:
This conditional jump alters program execution:

If condition is met (not equal), it jumps forward, skipping some instructions.

Otherwise, it continues line-by-line.

Used typically in:

if (x != y) logic

Input validation or error checks

STRACE SYSTEM CALL SUMMARY:

ðŸ”¸ Observed System Calls & Explanation
Syscall	Description
write(1, ...): Output to terminal (stdout), used to prompt for user input and print messages
read(0, ...): Read from terminal (stdin), used to capture names from the user
openat(...): Open or create files (students.txt, sorted_students.txt)
fstat(...): Retrieve metadata about the opened file (e.g., size, type)
close(...): Close an opened file descriptor
read(3, ...): Read contents from the file (likely to load stored student names)
write(3, ...): Write to files: first to save the names, then to store the sorted names
exit_group(0): Exit the program successfully

ðŸ”¸ Program Behavior (Inferred)
Based on the syscalls and arguments:

User Input Phase

The program prompts the user to input student names using write(1, ...).

The names are read using read(0, ...), and this continues sequentially for 5 students (Student 6 to Student 10).

File Write Phase (Raw Input Storage)

The program opens students.txt with O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC, meaning:

If the file doesn't exist, it is created.

If it exists, it is cleared (truncated) before writing.

It writes all the collected names to this file and closes it.

File Read Phase (Load for Sorting)

The same file (students.txt) is opened again and its contents read â€” possibly to prepare for sorting.

File Write Phase (Sorted Output)

It creates sorted_students.txt, then writes the sorted list of names into it.

Afterward, it prints a success message to the terminal.

Program Termination

The program exits cleanly with exit_group(0).

GDB ANALYSIS

Breakpoints Set
Breakpoint 1: Set at the entry of the main() function at address 0x00005555555552b1. This allowed inspection of the initial program state.

Breakpoint 2: Set at instruction address 0x5555555552e0 inside the main() function, triggered after the prompt "Enter 10 full names of students" appeared.

Watchpoint 3: Set on the memory location *(int*)($rbp - 0x10), to observe write activity to a local integer variable.

Initial Register State at Entry of main
rdi = 1: Indicates the argument count (argc = 1).

rsi = 0x7fffffffdda8: Pointer to the argv array.

rsp = rbp = 0x7fffffffdc80: Stack frame initialized for main, showing the start of a new function call frame.

Attempting to inspect argv[0] at $rsi yielded non-readable characters, suggesting the argument may not be a valid C string or memory corruption may be present at that moment.

Instruction Trace (x/5i $rip)
The first five instructions of main were:

asm
Copy
Edit
0x5555555552b1 <main+8>:    sub    $0x3f0,%rsp
0x5555555552b8 <main+15>:   mov    %fs:0x28,%rax
0x5555555552c1 <main+24>:   mov    %rax,-0x8(%rbp)
0x5555555552c5 <main+28>:   xor    %eax,%eax
0x5555555552c7 <main+30>:   mov    $0xa,%esi
Explanation:

sub $0x3f0, %rsp: Allocates 1008 bytes on the stack (likely for local variables or buffers).

mov %fs:0x28, %rax and subsequent store: Sets up thread-local storage or stack canary.

xor %eax, %eax: Sets eax = 0 (common C idiom to set return value to 0).

mov $0xa, %esi: Loads 10 into esi, possibly preparing for a loop or function call.

Function Transition and Runtime Behavior
Continued execution led to a prompt: Enter 10 full names of students:

At this point, control reached the second breakpoint at 0x5555555552e0, still within main, suggesting user input is handled next.

This confirms that the program interacts with standard I/O, likely reading names and storing them in memory.

Stack Inspection
Using x/10gx $rsp, the stack contents revealed several 64-bit values. Notably:

0x00007fffffffd9d0, 0x00007ffff7fd4ae3: Likely return addresses or saved register values.

Presence of 0x0000000000000009 suggests integer values are being used or returned within the stack.

Watchpoint Observation
A watchpoint was set on *(int*)($rbp - 0x10), a likely local variable.

This will allow detection of when the program writes to this specific memory address, revealing how and when variables are manipulated within main.
